Question: 
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
Java does not allow user to create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category because the user has two constructors with the same signature (both with String parameter). This is not allowed, since there's nothing that distinguishes between the two.
